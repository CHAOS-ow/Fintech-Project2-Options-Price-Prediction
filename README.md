# Options Trading
## Hypothesis
Leveraging the fb prophet machine learning tool, input stock price data and create short-term predictions for a particular stock. Using yfinance options pricing data we will compare against the predicted prices, calculating profit probability for various confidence levels of the predicted stock price. The end goal is to determine and rank order the most profitable options trades for a specified window of time. We will then backtest these "maximized profitable trades'' against actual trading results.
